# Planar biped robot prototype

First upload, basic files for creating a biped robot

Please see file biped_prototype_MAIN.stl for final result

Needed:
    5 Dynamixel AX-12 (or compatible) servos:
	4 for legs
	1 for measuring the angle of the torso - rip the gears out for lower friction
	(or leave the gears if you want to experiment and cheat during walking)
